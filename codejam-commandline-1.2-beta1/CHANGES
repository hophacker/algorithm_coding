GCJ Command Line v1.2-beta1, released 2012-07-26

WARNING: Previous versions of the commandline tool don't work anymore, because
the problem information returned by the server changed its format.

[Feature]: Check that the current version is accepted by the host.

[Fix]: Modify tool to receive all problem and I/O set information from the
       server, keeping support for arbitrary I/O sets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GCJ Command Line v1.1-beta1, released 2012-06-08

Previous versions of the commandline tool still work, but will not be able to
handle problems with I/O sets different from small/large.

[Feature]: Support for arbitrary number of I/O sets for each problem. This
           includes support for problems with no small I/O sets, no large I/O
           sets and multiple I/O sets of the same type.

GCJ Command Line v1.0-beta4, released 2011-06-03

[Feature]: Source files specified in the configuration files and using the -a
           option in gcj_submit_solution.py can now be glob patterns.

[Feature]: In the tools/ directory there is an update_hashbangs.py script to
           change the hashbang line of a bulk of python files using a single
           command.

[Fix]: --base_dir option was not working in gcj_submit_solution.py.

[Fix]: Default value for --base_dir was not following symlinks properly.

[Fix]: User status script was crashing when the user is not logged in or did
       not participate in the contest.

[Fix]: Configuration file reading was crashing when spaces were inserted before
       the opening brace. A fix was made to clean the configuration file before
       attempting to parse it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GCJ Command Line v1.0-beta3, released 2011-05-12

[Feature]: New script to get the current user status from the server, showing
           the time at which each input was solved, wrong tries and time left
           for the current attempt.

[Feature]: Add support to parametrize configuration file paths with the base
           directory. Use --base_dir option to override auto-detection.

[Feature]: Init contest script now autodetects the current contest if no contest
           id is specified in the arguments.

[Fix]: Use memory-mapped files to compress and decompress network traffic and
       source files, no need for temporary files.
