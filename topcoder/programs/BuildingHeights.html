<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><p>Byteland is a city with many skyscrapers, so it's a perfect venue for BASE jumping. Danilo is an enthusiastic BASE jumper. He plans to come to Byteland and to jump off some of its buildings.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Danilo can make arbitrarily many jumps in Byteland. However, he has some rules. First, he never jumps off the same building twice. Second, all buildings he selects for his jumps must have the same number of floors. (This is for safety reasons: It is hard to get the timing right if each jump starts at a different height.)</p>
<br></br>
<p>Philipe is the mayor of Byteland. He welcomes Danilo's visit as he would like to use it as a publicity stunt. Of course, the more jumps Danilo makes, the better the publicity will be. But what if there aren't enough buildings with the same height? To avoid this issue, the mayor is willing to prepare the town for Danilo's visit. Before Danilo arrives, Philipe wants to build additional floors on some of the skyscrapers in Byteland.</p>
<br></br>
<p>You are given a vector &lt;int&gt; <b>heights</b>. Each element of <b>heights</b> is the number of floors in one of Byteland's skyscrapers. Let N be the number of elements in <b>heights</b>. For each M between 1 and N, inclusive, answer the following question: What is the smallest number of additional floors the mayor has to build so that there will be at least M buildings with the same number of floors?</p>
<br></br>
<p>For each i between 1 and N, inclusive, let A[i] be the answer to the above question for M = i+1. Return the value (A[1] XOR A[2] XOR ... XOR A[N]).</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>BuildingHeights</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>minimum</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int minimum(vector &lt;int&gt; heights)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Limits</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Time limit (s):</td><td>2.000</td></tr><tr><td>Memory limit (MB):</td><td>256</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>You may assume that the correct return value always fits into a signed 32-bit integer variable.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each question should be answered independently of the others.

<li>Danilo can jump off a building without any changes to the city.</li>
<li>To get two equally tall buildings we need to build one additional floor. For example, we can increase building #2 (0-based index) from 4 to 5 floors.</li>
<li>To get three equally tall buildings we need to build three additional floors: one on building #2 and two on building #3. This way, the buildings #1, #2, and #3 will have 5 floors each.</li>

<li>Making all five buildings equally tall requires us to build 19 additional floors.</li>
